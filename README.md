Just trying a new thing
Hello

I am new here, but ready to see where this goes.

I am normally a writer and a painter for illustration work. But, I wanted to give this a try.

Good day.


First make a branch, title projects segment. go to commit, make a line of text explaining changes. Commit changes and then pull request to merge 2 documents.
THis is basically a folder of the project, a word document to write down changes, then combining two word documents to make them one and keep the project organized. 
What you do here is to write down your changes and why.

ok goodbye
